# Additional Tasks for the Vehicle Routing Project (Optional but highly recommended)

# 1. Parameter Tuning:
# Task: Vary parameters like population size, mutation rate, or tournament size. Analyze their impact on the results.
# Purpose: Learn the importance of parameter tuning in genetic algorithms and how it affects outcomes.

# 2. Fitness Score Analysis Over Generations:
# Task: Plot the fitness score of the best individual over generations for different configurations.
# Purpose: Visualize and understand the convergence behavior of the algorithm under different settings.

# 3. Solution Diversity Analysis:
# Task: Implement a method to measure and report the diversity of solutions in the population over time.
# Purpose: Explore the balance between exploration and exploitation in genetic algorithms.
